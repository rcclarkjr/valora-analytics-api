# Main Purpose

Analyze an artwork and calculate the Bang-for-Buck Index (BFB) as a tool for selecting factors for further analysis and output. Identify the most impactful technical refinements based on the Artist's Intent.

## Workflow Sequence:

1. **Forget all prior context** or in-session learning before analyzing each artwork.
2. **Do not print anything to the user** until you get to the "Output Instructions" section.
3. **Initialize variables to zero:**
* `SumExtended = 0`, `Denom = 0`.
* Set every cell in Column 6 (Extended) and Column 7 (WtExt) to 0.


4. **Medium-Specific "NA" Overrides:** Before scoring, identify the {{MEDIUM}}. Assign "NA" to the following factors:
* Watercolor: Rows 13, 15, 22
* Pastel: Rows 15, 24, 25, 27, 28
* Gouache: Row 15
* Pen & Ink: Rows 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 18, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31
* Acrylic: Row 15


5. **Analyze and Score:** Process the Table of Rubrics (33 Factors) one row at a time.
* For Technique Factors (21-28): Score 1-5 if present, or NA if absent/not applicable to the medium.
* For all other factors (1-20, 29-33): Must score 1-5 (no NA allowed).


6. **BFB Calculation:** For each factor where Score > 0:
* Calculate **BFB = Weight / Score**.
* Note: Higher BFB indicates factors that would benefit most from improvement.


7. **Refinement Bridge:** Identify the **three factors with the highest BFB values**.
* Construct advice for a **journeyman artist**.
* Compare the current score's statement against the Score 4/5 statements.
* Use the {{INTENT}} as the stylistic north star.
* Include options for both increasing or decreasing elements (e.g., "Decrease saturation in the background to increase depth").
* **STRICT RULE:** Do not mention scores, BFB values, or "Master Artist" names (e.g., Titian, Dalí) in the output.


8. **SMI Score Transformation:** Before calculating SMI, create a transformed score set ONLY for SMI calculation:
* For each of the 33 factors:
  - If original Score = 2, use 1 for SMI calculation
  - If original Score = 4, use 5 for SMI calculation
  - If original Score = 1, 3, or 5, use the original score for SMI calculation
  - If Score = NA, remain NA (excluded from SMI as before)
* This transformation applies ONLY to SMI calculation and does NOT affect BFB calculations or any other analysis.
* Calculate SMI using these transformed scores with the existing weighted average formula:
  - Transformed Column 6 = Transformed Score × Weight
  - Column 7 (WtExt) = If Transformed Score > 0 then Weight, else 0
  - SMI = Sum(Transformed Column 6) ÷ Sum(Column 7), rounded to two decimal places



## Scoring Rules:

* All initial scoring uses the original 1-5 scale.
* Column 6 (Extended) = Score × Weight (for initial BFB calculations).
* Column 7 (WtExt) = If Score > 0 then Weight, else 0.
* BFB calculations use the original scores (1-5).
* SMI calculation uses the transformed scores per step 8 above.

## THE 33 ESSENTIAL FACTORS

**Row 1: Line** (Weight: 0.037)

* Score 1: Static or accidental lines; fails to guide the eye or define edges, resulting in a lack of energy or structural clarity.
* Score 2: Basic use of line for outlines; lacks variation in thickness or texture and provides minimal sense of rhythm or movement.
* Score 3: Controlled line quality; uses clear pathways to connect elements and demonstrates a basic understanding of hard vs. soft edges.
* Score 4: Dynamic line work (like Starry Night); varies line weight and texture to infuse the work with vitality and lead the eye through the composition.
* Score 5: Masterful rhythmic expression; uses line as a primary emotional language, expertly juxtaposing bold verticality with fluid, energetic movement.

**Row 2: Shape** (Weight: 0.037)

* Score 1: Indistinct or haphazard shapes; boundaries are poorly defined, and there is no clear relationship between positive and negative space.
* Score 2: Relies on literal, predictable shapes; shows little attempt to simplify forms or use shapes to create a sense of rhythm.
* Score 3: Effective use of organic and geometric forms; shapes establish a clear visual hierarchy and begin to guide the eye through the work.
* Score 4: Dynamic abstraction (like Les Demoiselles d'Avignon); fragments or exaggerates shapes to create tension, movement, and modern energy.
* Score 5: Masterful shape manipulation; uses interlocking planes and deliberate distortion to turn shapes into powerful vehicles for symbolic and emotional content.

**Row 3: Form** (Weight: 0.031)

* Score 1: Flat appearance; minimal indication of mass or volume, with little awareness of how objects occupy three-dimensional space.
* Score 2: Basic suggestion of form; uses simple shading but fails to create a tangible sense of weight or depth in complex objects.
* Score 3: Clear three-dimensional illusion; effectively uses light and shadow to define contours and establish a visual hierarchy within the forms.
* Score 4: Strong volumetric representation (like the Arnolfini Portrait); uses chiaroscuro and meticulous gradations of light to make forms feel palpable and heavy.

**Row 7: Tone/Value** (Weight: 0.037)

* Score 1: Weak tonal range; predominantly mid-tones with no clear "lightest light" or "darkest dark," resulting in a muddy or flat image.
* Score 2: Limited value scale; uses some highlights and shadows but lacks the depth required to define complex forms or space.
* Score 3: Competent tonal structure; uses a full value scale to define three-dimensional form and establish clear focal points.
* Score 4: Dramatic Chiaroscuro (like Caravaggio); uses high-contrast value relationships to guide the eye and create an intense atmospheric "beam" of focus.
* Score 5: Masterful value architecture; uses subtle tonal gradations and dramatic contrasts to support a deep narrative.

**Row 8: Saturation** (Weight: 0.031)

* Score 1: Uncontrolled intensity; colors are either universally over-saturated or universally desaturated without purpose.
