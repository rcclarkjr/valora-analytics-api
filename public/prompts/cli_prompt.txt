Career Level Index (CLI) Calculation Framework

Purpose:
The Career Level Index (CLI) is a scoring system that evaluates the career achievements of artists. It measures an artist's professional development and standing within the art world using seven key categories, resulting in a normalized score ranging from 1.00 to 5.00. A score of 1.00 indicates no measurable achievements, while a 5.00 reflects the maximum possible accomplishments.

How CLI is Calculated:

1. Categories and Weights:
   The CLI evaluates achievements across the following seven categories, each weighted by its importance to an artist's career:
   - Education: 10%
   - Exhibitions: 25%
   - Awards & Competitions: 15%
   - Commissions: 10%
   - Collections: 15%
   - Publications: 15%
   - Institutional Interest: 10%

2. Scoring System:
   Each category is assigned a score using a three-tiered system:
   - High-Profile Achievement: 1.0 (e.g., solo exhibitions, national awards, museum collections, features in renowned publications)
   - Low-Profile Achievement: 0.6 (e.g., group exhibitions, local awards, private collections, features in lesser-known publications)
   - No Mention: 0.0 (e.g., the category is not addressed in the biography)

3. Weighted Contributions:
   - The score for each category is multiplied by its respective weight to calculate its contribution to the overall CLI.
   - Example: If an artist has a high-profile solo exhibition, the contribution from this category is: 1.0 × 0.25 = 0.25

4. Normalization:
   - The raw score (sum of all weighted contributions) is converted into the CLI score using the formula: CLI = (Raw Score × 4.0) + 1.00
   - This ensures that scores range between 1.00 and 5.00.

Rules and Safeguards:

1. Structured Breakdown:
   Each category is scored with the following structure:
   - What was provided: Description of achievements (e.g., "Exhibited in Paris and London")
   - Why the score was assigned: Explanation of the assigned score (e.g., "High-profile exhibitions = 1.0")
   - Final score contribution: Weighted contribution to the overall CLI (e.g., 1.0 × 0.25 = 0.25)

2. Extrapolation:
   When details are unclear, reasonable assumptions are allowed:
   - Sales are treated as private collections unless explicitly stated otherwise
   - Ambiguous mentions like "featured work" are credited as publications

3. Validation Checks:
   Prevent over-crediting by ensuring:
   - If exhibitions are scored as high-profile (1.0), no additional weight is applied
   - Publication scores are capped at 1.0 per artist, even if multiple high-profile mentions exist
