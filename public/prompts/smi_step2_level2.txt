# SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) - STEP 2 EVALUATION
## Decimal Refinement for LEVEL 2 Work

You have determined this work is **LEVEL 2: Apprentice**.

**This decision is LOCKED. Do not reconsider the integer level.**

Your task now is to determine WHERE within Level 2 this work falls by selecting which of the 5 profiles below best describes the work.

---

## The 5 Dimensions (Reference Framework)

As you read each profile, consider these aspects:

1. **Technical Control** - How clean and intentional is the execution?
2. **Compositional Intelligence** - How effectively does the structure serve the work?
3. **Color/Value Architecture** - How sophisticated is the color and value system?
4. **Surface Quality** - How refined or intentional is the physical handling?
5. **Expressive Voice** - How distinctive and emotionally coherent is the work?

## Level 2 Dimensional Profiles

### **2.0 - Just Entered Apprentice**

- **Technical Control:** Can copy references with basic accuracy, but significant proportion/perspective errors remain; some areas are tight, others are loose and unfinished
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Attempts rule-based compositions (rule of thirds, centered subjects) but execution feels awkward or unbalanced; formulas don't quite work
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Uses local color from reference; color harmony is accidental rather than planned; values create some form but inconsistently
- **Surface Quality:** Inconsistent mark-making; some areas show control and confidence, others are hesitant, muddy, or overworked
- **Expressive Voice:** Still heavily imitative; tries to replicate specific styles or artists; could be anyone learning the same reference method

**Key indicator:** Just graduated from tool-struggle phase but results vary wildly between attempts; "beginner following tutorials"

---

### **2.2 - Early Apprentice**

- **Technical Control:** Growing accuracy in replication; most proportions work, perspective has only minor issues; anatomy is recognizable but may lack refinement
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Successfully applies basic compositional rules (rule of thirds, focal points, balance) but formulaically; compositions feel "textbook"
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Beginning to understand color temperature and complementary relationships; can create basic harmony schemes deliberately
- **Surface Quality:** More consistent stroke quality throughout; beginning to differentiate textures intentionally; fewer muddy areas or overworked passages
- **Expressive Voice:** Recognizable as competent student work; follows established styles and methods reliably; quality is becoming consistent piece-to-piece

**Key indicator:** Rules are being learned and applied with growing success; "good student following instructions well"

---

### **2.4 - Mid Apprentice**

- **Technical Control:** Reliable accuracy in most areas; anatomy/perspective are mostly correct; can execute complex subjects if working from good references
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Confidently applies composition formulas; results are balanced, readable, and pleasant; understands why rules exist
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Uses color theory deliberately (warm/cool contrast, complementary schemes, analogous harmonies) to create basic depth and interest
- **Surface Quality:** Controlled and even handling throughout; can replicate different textures from reference; surface quality supports rather than distracts
- **Expressive Voice:** Solid, consistent student work; demonstrates technical competency reliably; still generic but no longer uncertain

**Key indicator:** Fundamentals are reliable; could produce "good student work" consistently on demand; "solid B+ student"

---

### **2.6 - Late Apprentice**

- **Technical Control:** Very few fundamental errors; execution is clean and confident; handles challenging subjects (foreshortening, complex lighting) competently
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Experiments beyond basic formulas with some success; compositions feel more natural and less rigid; understands when to break rules
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Sophisticated use of color harmony and temperature; personal palette preferences emerging; can push saturation or value for effect
- **Surface Quality:** Refined handling; achieves desired surface effects consistently; mark-making is becoming more economical and purposeful
- **Expressive Voice:** Small personal touches emerging (favorite color ranges, preferred subjects, characteristic handling); beginning to look less generic

**Key indicator:** Mastery of the rules is near-complete; hints of moving beyond them; "top student approaching graduation"

---

### **2.8 - Approaching Journeyman**

- **Technical Control:** Excellent accuracy and consistency; can execute very complex subjects without major errors; technique is reliable and efficient
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Breaks rules occasionally and successfully; compositions feel intentional and authored rather than formulaic; shows creative problem-solving
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Confident color mixing and temperature control; distinctive palette forming; uses color expressively, not just descriptively
- **Surface Quality:** Very refined and consistent; can achieve any desired surface effect; economical mark-making that suggests rather than overworks
- **Expressive Voice:** Recognizable personal preferences forming; work is beginning to have a signature look; less interchangeable with other competent work

**Key indicator:** Could almost pass for early Level 3; just needs more consistency in working independently without reference; shows emerging voice

## Your Task

**Read all 5 profiles above.**

**Select which profile BEST describes the work you evaluated.**

This is a pattern-matching exercise, not a calculation. Which description fits most closely?

**Do not reconsider whether this is Level 2.** You are only determining: Is it 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, or 2.8?
