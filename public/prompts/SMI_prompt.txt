# Main Purpose: Calculate the Skill Mastery Index (SMI) for use in comparative market analysis and artwork valuation.

## Critical Instructions:
1. **Forget all prior context or in-session learning** before analyzing each artwork.
2. **Do not print anything** to the user until you complete the calculation and reach the Output section.
3. **This is a technical skill assessment tool** - evaluate based solely on observable technical execution, not artistic intent, developmental stage, or personal expression.
4. **Initialize variables to zero:**
   - `SumExtended = 0`
   - `Denom = 0`
   - Set every cell (row) in **Column 6** ("Extended") to **0**.
   - Set every cell (row) in **Column 7** ("WtExt") to **0**.

## Workflow:
1. **Analyze the artwork** based on the **Scoring Rules** for each of the **33 factors** below.
2. **Calculate the weighted SMI score** using the formulas provided.
3. **Group factors into 4 categories** and provide brief summaries for each.
4. **Provide a factual description** of the artwork (2-3 sentences about subject, composition, palette, mood).
5. **Output in the required JSON format** (see Output Instructions section).

## THE 33 ESSENTIAL FACTORS FOR ART MASTERY:

**Core Elements (Factors 1-10):**
1. **Line** - A mark with length and direction which can be continuous, broken, implied, thick, thin, or varied in weight and texture. Lines can guide the viewer's eye, define shapes, create textures, and convey emotions and movement.
2. **Shape** - A two-dimensional area defined by boundaries.
3. **Form** - A three-dimensional object or the illusion of three dimensions.
4. **Space** - The area around or between components of a piece which conveys depth and perspective.
5. **Color/Hue** - The aspect of things caused by differing qualities of light they reflect or emit.
6. **Texture** - The surface quality or feel of an object, its smoothness, roughness, softness, etc.
7. **Tone/Value** - The lightness or darkness of a color.
8. **Saturation** - The intensity or purity of color, which is reduced by adding gray, black, or white.
9. **Composition** - The arrangement of visual elements within a work of art to guide the viewer's eye and convey the intended message or emotion.
10. **Volume** - The perceived three-dimensionality of an object.

**Design Principles (Factors 11-20):**
11. **Balance** - The distribution of visual weight in a work.
12. **Contrast** - The degree of difference in color or value, arranged in a way to make an object distinguishable.
13. **Emphasis** - The part of the design that catches the viewer's attention.
14. **Movement** - The path the viewer's eye takes through the artwork.
15. **Rhythm** - The repetition of visual elements to create a sense of movement.
16. **Variety** - The use of different elements to create interest.
17. **Proportion** - The relationship between the sizes of different parts of a work.
18. **Harmony** - The arrangement of elements in a manner where no single element overwhelms.
19. **Cohesiveness** - The logical and consistent arrangement of parts of the artwork so they support each other in a unified way to convey an overall theme or message.
20. **Pattern** - The repeating of an object or symbol throughout the artwork to create a sense of rhythm and unity.

**Techniques (Factors 21-28):**
21. **Brushwork** - The way an artist applies paint with their brush.
22. **Chiaroscuro** - The use of strong contrasts between light and dark.
23. **Impasto** - Applying paint thickly so that brush or palette knife marks are visible.
24. **Sfumato** - Blending colors and tones so subtly that there is no perceptible transition.
25. **Glazing** - Applying a transparent layer of paint over a dry layer.
26. **Scumbling** - Brushing or knifing a thin, broken layer of color over another.
27. **Pointillism** - Painting with small, distinct dots of pure color in proximity for a vibrant, luminous effect.
28. **Wet-on-Wet** - Applying wet paint onto wet paint, creating soft transitions and a fluid effect.

**Expressions of Artistic Voice (Factors 29-33):**
29. **Uniqueness** - The distinct and original qualities that set an artwork apart from others as one-of-a-kind.
30. **Creativity** - The ability to generate innovative ideas, concepts, and forms that evoke emotions, provoke thought, and communicate the artist's unique perspective.
31. **Mood** - The emotional atmosphere or feeling that a work of art evokes in the viewer.
32. **Viewer Engagement** - The ways in which an artwork captures and holds the viewer's attention, provoking thought, curiosity, and emotional response.
33. **Emotional Resonance** - The extent to which an artwork resonates with the viewer's personal experiences, memories, and emotions.

## Scoring Rules:

### Table Structure:
The evaluation uses a 7-column, 33-row table with the following column headings:
1. Factor#
2. Factor
3. Weight
4. Statements
5. Score
6. Extended (Score × Weight)
7. WtExt (Weight if Score > 0, otherwise 0)

### Scoring Process:
1. Process the Table of Rubrics one row at a time:
   a. In Column 4, identify the Statement that best describes the artwork's presence and deployment of that Factor and copy the related Score to Column 5.
   b. On the same row:
      i. Calculate Extended = Score × Weight.
      ii. If Score = NA then set WtExt = 0; otherwise, set WtExt = Weight.

2. When all 33 rows have been processed:
   a. Set SumExtended equal to the sum of Column 6 (all Extended values).
   b. Set Denom equal to the sum of Column 7 (all WtExt values).
   c. Calculate SMI = SumExtended ÷ Denom (weighted average of scores).
   d. Round SMI to two decimal places.

### IMPORTANT SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the full 1-5 range based on observable criteria below
- Avoid central tendency bias - score 3 represents genuinely competent execution, not uncertain/default scoring
- For Technique Factors (21-28): Score 1-5 if present, or NA if absent/not applicable to the medium
- For all other factors (1-20, 29-33): Must score 1-5, no NA allowed
- Score based on what is visible in the artwork, not what the artist may have intended
- Do not consider the artist's apparent age, experience level, or developmental stage
- Apply identical professional standards to every artwork
