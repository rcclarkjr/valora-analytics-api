### **Skill Mastery Index (SMI)**  

**Task:**  
This assessment measures technical execution quality for use in comparative market analysis.

Evaluate a given artwork to assess five fundamental artistic criteria. This evaluation assumes all artworks are striving for professional-level execution, regardless of style or subject matter. Scores should be assigned with strict adherence to the rubric, without consideration for artistic intent, personal expression, or developmental stage. **For example, if an artwork looks like it was created by a child because it has no technique or compositional qualities, grade it unfiltered by who the artist is, grade it honestly without reservation, as though you are telling an adult that their work is bad. You can be diplomatic in the narrative describing the weaknesses, but do not be diplomatic in the scoring.**  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Analyze the artwork in detail** based solely on the five criteria below. Do not incorporate external factors such as artist reputation, past evaluations, or market value.  
2. **Assign a score from 1.00 to 5.00 in 0.50 increments** for each category, ensuring strict adherence to the rubric. Apply scoring without bias or encouragement. This is a technical assessment tool, not an educational evaluation. **CRITICAL: Do not consider the artist's apparent age, experience level, or developmental stage. Do not use phrases like 'good for a beginner,' 'shows promise,' 'appropriate for a child,' or 'expected for their level.' Evaluate only the absolute technical mastery visible in the work using identical professional standards for every artwork.** **Scoring Methodology: Choose the highest score level where the artwork demonstrates the majority of the described characteristics.**  
3. **Scoring Methodology: Choose the highest score level where the artwork demonstrates the majority of the described characteristics.**  
4. **Final SMI Calculation:**  
  a. Multiply each category's score by its weight:  
   - **Composition & Design (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Color & Light (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Technical Skill (25%)** = Score × 0.25  
   - **Originality (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Emotional Depth (15%)** = Score × 0.15  
  b. Sum the weighted scores to determine the final **Skill Mastery Index (SMI)**.  
5. **Output Format:**
You must provide your analysis in valid JSON format only. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. The JSON must contain exactly these fields:

{
  "category_scores": {
    "composition": 3.5,
    "color": 4.0, 
    "technical": 3.0,
    "originality": 3.5,
    "emotional": 3.0
  },
  "brief_summary": "Three sentences: two highlighting the artwork's main strengths, followed by one diplomatically noting areas for potential development"
}

### **Scoring Requirements:**  
- Each category score must be between 1.00 and 5.00 in 0.50 increments only
- All five category scores are required: composition, color, technical, originality, emotional
- **Scoring Methodology: Choose the highest score level where the artwork demonstrates the majority of the described characteristics**
- The response must be valid JSON format only with no additional text

### **Evaluation Criteria & Scoring Rubric**  

#### **1. Composition & Design (20%)**  
Assess the arrangement of elements, balance, focal points, and visual flow.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Flawless structure, seamless visual flow, highly intentional arrangement.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Well-balanced with strong focal points, only minor weaknesses.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Effective composition with some minor issues (e.g., slight imbalance, awkward negative space).  
- **3.5 (Good):** Functional but noticeable weaknesses (e.g., weak focal points, lack of depth).  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Structurally weak composition (e.g., unintentional imbalance, cluttered or empty areas).  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Poor design choices, lack of focal clarity, little consideration for balance.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Ineffective layout, elements feel randomly placed.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Composition is chaotic or lacking intention; no clear structure.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** Completely ineffective composition, elements feel accidental or disconnected.  

#### **2. Color Harmony & Use of Light (20%)**  
Evaluate color relationships, contrast, and lighting effectiveness.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Perfect color harmony, precise contrast, lighting enhances depth and realism.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Highly effective color usage, excellent contrast, only minor areas of inconsistency.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Good color balance, mostly effective lighting, some minor inconsistencies.  
- **3.5 (Good):** Decent color choices but occasional muddy or flat areas.  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Unrefined color relationships, weak lighting effects.  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Poor color harmony, weak contrast, lighting lacks realism.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Disorganized or unpleasant color scheme, unnatural lighting.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Color and light feel random or haphazard.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** No apparent understanding of color relationships or light.  

#### **3. Technical Skill & Craftsmanship (25%)**  
Judge the level of mastery in execution, precision, and control of materials.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Flawless execution, extreme attention to detail, mastery of the medium.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Highly refined, minor imperfections, impressive control.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Technically sound but some visible inconsistencies.
