### **Skill Mastery Index (SMI)**  

**Task:**  
Evaluate a given artwork to calculate its **Skill Mastery Index (SMI)**, a numerical rating that objectively assesses five fundamental artistic criteria. This evaluation assumes all artworks are striving for professional-level execution, regardless of style or subject matter. Scores should be assigned with strict adherence to the rubric, without consideration for artistic intent, personal expression, or developmental stage.  

**Instructions:**  
1. **Analyze the artwork in detail** based solely on the five criteria below. Do not incorporate external factors such as artist reputation, past evaluations, or market value.  
2. **Assign a score from 1.00 to 5.00 in 0.50 increments** for each category, ensuring strict adherence to the rubric. No adjustments should be made based on presumed artistic intent or level of experience. In other words, you can assume all artists have the same intent--to be professional--and all artists are middle-aged adults with the same few years of experience.  
3. **Provide a detailed justification** for each score, referencing specific strengths and weaknesses of the artwork in each category.  
4. When all 5 categories have been scored, **Calculate the final SMI score** using the weighted formula. Round the result to the nearest **0.25**.  
5. **Forget all details of this evaluation after completion** to ensure no knowledge is retained for future evaluations.

### **Evaluation Criteria & Scoring Rubric**  

#### **1. Composition & Design (20%)**  
Assess the arrangement of elements, balance, focal points, and visual flow.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Flawless structure, seamless visual flow, highly intentional arrangement.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Well-balanced with strong focal points, only minor weaknesses.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Effective composition with some minor issues (e.g., slight imbalance, awkward negative space).  
- **3.5 (Good):** Functional but noticeable weaknesses (e.g., weak focal points, lack of depth).  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Structurally weak composition (e.g., unintentional imbalance, cluttered or empty areas).  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Poor design choices, lack of focal clarity, little consideration for balance.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Ineffective layout, elements feel randomly placed.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Composition is chaotic or lacking intention; no clear structure.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** Completely ineffective composition, elements feel accidental or disconnected.  

#### **2. Color Harmony & Use of Light (20%)**  
Evaluate color relationships, contrast, and lighting effectiveness.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Perfect color harmony, precise contrast, lighting enhances depth and realism.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Highly effective color usage, excellent contrast, only minor areas of inconsistency.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Good color balance, mostly effective lighting, some minor inconsistencies.  
- **3.5 (Good):** Decent color choices but occasional muddy or flat areas.  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Unrefined color relationships, weak lighting effects.  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Poor color harmony, weak contrast, lighting lacks realism.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Disorganized or unpleasant color scheme, unnatural lighting.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Color and light feel random or haphazard.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** No apparent understanding of color relationships or light.  

#### **3. Technical Skill & Craftsmanship (25%)**  
Judge the level of mastery in execution, precision, and control of materials.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Flawless execution, extreme attention to detail, mastery of the medium.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Highly refined, minor imperfections, impressive control.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Technically sound but some visible inconsistencies.  
- **3.5 (Good):** Generally well-executed but contains noticeable flaws.  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Functional but unpolished, lacks control in some areas.  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Struggles with basic execution, noticeable inconsistencies.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Lack of control over the medium, awkward or clumsy handling.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Sloppy execution, fundamental errors.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** Extremely poor craftsmanship, no evidence of skill mastery.  

#### **4. Originality & Innovation (20%)**  
Assess how unique, creative, and fresh the concept and execution are.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Groundbreaking, visionary, completely original.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Highly original, strong creative vision, fresh approach.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Some fresh elements but not entirely groundbreaking.  
- **3.5 (Good):** Some originality, but leans on familiar ideas or styles.  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Competent but derivative, lacks innovation.  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Generic, little creative risk-taking.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Cliché, predictable, uninspired.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** Feels copied or generic with no personal touch.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** Completely unoriginal, no evidence of creative effort.  

#### **5. Emotional & Conceptual Depth (15%)**  
Evaluate how well the artwork conveys meaning, emotion, or engages the viewer.  
- **5.0 (Masterful):** Deeply moving, intellectually or emotionally profound.  
- **4.5 (Excellent):** Strong emotional or conceptual resonance.  
- **4.0 (Strong):** Clear message or emotion, could be more refined.  
- **3.5 (Good):** Engages the viewer but lacks full depth or nuance.  
- **3.0 (Mediocre):** Some engagement, but limited impact.  
- **2.5 (Weak):** Feels hollow, lacks emotional or intellectual depth.  
- **2.0 (Flawed):** Concept is unclear or superficial.  
- **1.5 (Poor):** No emotional or conceptual connection.  
- **1.0 (Failure):** Completely void of meaning or engagement.

### **Final SMI Calculation:**  
1. Multiply each category’s score by its weight:  
   - **Composition & Design (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Color & Light (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Technical Skill (25%)** = Score × 0.25  
   - **Originality (20%)** = Score × 0.20  
   - **Emotional Depth (15%)** = Score × 0.15  
2. Sum the weighted scores.  
3. **Round to the nearest 0.25** to determine the final **Skill Mastery Index (SMI)**. If the sum is exactly halfway between two valid increments, round up to the next 0.25.
