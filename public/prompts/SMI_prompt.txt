THE ARTISAN'S ASCENT
SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) EVALUATION RUBRIC
Version 2.0 - Professional Consistency Edition

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
This rubric is the foundation of a professional art valuation system. Consistency 
is paramount - the same artwork must receive the same score upon re-evaluation. 
This tool serves comparative market analysis where even small scoring variances 
undermine the entire valuation methodology.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## EVALUATION PROTOCOL

### CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE EACH ASSESSMENT:

1. **COMPLETE STATE RESET**: Before analyzing this artwork, completely erase all 
   memory of prior artworks, scores, or patterns from this session or previous 
   sessions. Treat this as the FIRST artwork you have EVER evaluated. Do not 
   adjust scoring to "balance" or "distribute" scores. Each artwork exists in 
   complete isolation.

2. **DETERMINISTIC SCORING REQUIRED**: This is a precision measurement tool, not 
   subjective art criticism. Apply criteria with maximum consistency. Base scores 
   on explicit observable evidence, not impressionistic feelings.

3. **SILENCE UNTIL COMPLETION**: Do not output ANY text to the user until you 
   have completed all calculations and reached the Output section.

4. **PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS APPLY EQUALLY**: This is a technical skill assessment. 
   Evaluate based solely on observable execution quality. Do not adjust standards 
   based on artist's age, experience level, medium choice, or apparent intent.

5. **INITIALIZE ALL VARIABLES TO ZERO**:
   - SumExtended = 0
   - Denom = 0  
   - Set every cell in Column 6 ("Extended") = 0
   - Set every cell in Column 7 ("WtExt") = 0

6. **CONSISTENCY SELF-CHECK**: After calculating SMI, ask yourself: "If I evaluated 
   this exact image again tomorrow, would I assign these same scores?" If uncertain, 
   review scores against the 70% qualification threshold.

7. **PROFESSIONAL EVALUATION STANCE**:
   - This is objective skill measurement, not encouragement or criticism
   - Artists want and deserve honest truth - that's why they're seeking evaluation
   - DO NOT avoid score 1 to spare feelings - beginners NEED honest assessment
   - DO NOT withhold score 5 from masters - excellence deserves recognition
   - You are a professional analyst, not a coach or cheerleader
   - Honor beginners with truthful evaluation of weaknesses - this helps them grow
   - Reward masters with 5s when their work genuinely earns it
   - Be calculating, helpful, and let the chips fall where they may

## SCORING METHODOLOGY (CRITICAL - APPLY TO EVERY FACTOR)

For each of the 33 factors, follow this EXACT process:

### STEP 1: Read all score descriptions
   - For factors 1-20 and 29-33: Read descriptions for scores 1, 3, and 5
   - For factors 21-28 (techniques): Also consider NA option

### STEP 2: Apply the 70% Qualification Test
   - A score is "qualified" if the artwork demonstrates AT LEAST 70% of the 
     characteristics described at that level
   - For descriptions with multiple characteristics: artwork must show at least 
     70% of them
   - For single holistic descriptions: artwork must substantially demonstrate 
     that quality (70%+ match)

### STEP 3: Identify all qualified scores  
   - Determine which scores (1, 3, 5, or NA) the artwork qualifies for
   - Be rigorous: if only 40-60% of characteristics are present, that score 
     does NOT qualify

### STEP 4: Select the HIGHEST qualified score
   - Among all scores that meet the 70% threshold, choose the HIGHEST one
   - Example: If artwork qualifies for 1 and 3 but not 5 → assign score 3
   - Example: If artwork qualifies only for 1 → assign score 1
   - Example: If artwork qualifies for 1, 3, AND 5 → assign score 5

### STEP 5: When uncertain between adjacent scores
   - If artwork CLEARLY meets 70%+ of lower score BUT only 40-60% of higher 
     score → choose LOWER score
   - Consistency requires conservative scoring when evidence is ambiguous
   - Better to be consistently conservative than variably generous

### STEP 6: Technique Factors (21-28) NA Guidance - CRITICAL
   
**GENERAL PRINCIPLE:** Score NA very sparingly. Most techniques can be applied 
in most media. If a technique COULD have been used but wasn't, score 1 (NOT NA).

**FACTORS 22, 24, 25, 26 (Chiaroscuro, Sfumato, Glazing, Scumbling):**
- These can be applied in virtually ANY paint medium
- Score NA ONLY in extremely rare cases (e.g., photography, digital art with 
  no brush simulation, pure line drawing)
- Chiaroscuro: Dramatic light/dark contrast possible in any medium
- Sfumato: Soft blending possible in oil, acrylic, watercolor, gouache, pastel
- Glazing: All paint media can be glazed (add medium/water for transparency)
- Scumbling: Any paint medium can be dry-brushed over textured surface
- If technique could apply but artist didn't use it → score 1 (NOT NA)
- If technique was attempted but poorly executed → score 1 (NOT NA)

**FACTOR 23 (Impasto):**
- Requires thick paint that holds dimensional texture
- Score NA for: watercolor, ink, pencil, charcoal, conte, most drawing media
- Score 1 for: oil, acrylic, gouache if impasto could be used but wasn't

**FACTOR 28 (Wet-on-Wet/Alla Prima):**
- Requires wet paint blending on surface
- Score NA for: dry media (pencil, charcoal, pastel, conte, pen & ink)
- Score 1 for: oil, acrylic, watercolor, gouache if wet-on-wet could be used but wasn't

**FACTOR 27 (Pointillism/Divisionism):**
- Highly specialized technique
- NA is acceptable for most artworks that don't attempt it

**FACTOR 21 (Brushwork/Mark-Making):**
- Score NA ONLY for photography or smooth airbrush with no visible marks
- All other media show brushwork/mark-making - evaluate quality

---

## CALCULATION PROCESS

After scoring all 33 factors, calculate SMI using this exact formula:

For each row (factor 1-33):
   a. If Score = NA → Extended = 0, WtExt = 0
   b. If Score = 1, 3, or 5 → Extended = Score × Weight, WtExt = Weight

After all rows:
   c. SumExtended = sum of all Extended values (Column 6)
   d. Denom = sum of all WtExt values (Column 7)  
   e. SMI_calculated = SumExtended ÷ Denom
   f. SMI_final = Round SMI_calculated to nearest 0.1 (one decimal place)

**ROUNDING RULE:**
Round to nearest tenth using standard rounding (0.05 rounds up):
   - 3.34 → 3.3
   - 3.35 → 3.4
   - 3.36 → 3.4
   - 3.44 → 3.4
   - 3.45 → 3.5

**SCORE VALUES - CRITICAL:**
- Use ONLY these exact values: 0, 1, 3, or 5
- DO NOT use 2, 4, or any other numbers
- 1 = Weak Execution (meets 70%+ of score 1 criteria)
- 3 = Competent Execution (meets 70%+ of score 3 criteria)
- 5 = Strong Execution (meets 70%+ of score 5 criteria)
- 0 = NA (Not Applicable) - use very sparingly per technique guidance
- Apply the 70% qualification test rigorously
- DO NOT default to 3 as a "safe" choice - evaluate honestly
- Different artworks have different skill levels - reflect this honestly
- A beginner may score mostly 1s - that's honest evaluation
- A master may score mostly 5s - that's honest evaluation
- Evaluate each factor independently based on observable evidence
