# SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) - STEP 2 EVALUATION
## Decimal Refinement for LEVEL 1 Work

You have determined this work is **LEVEL 1: Novice**.

**This decision is LOCKED. Do not reconsider the integer level.**

Your task now is to determine WHERE within Level 1 this work falls by selecting which of the 5 profiles below best describes the work.

---

## The 5 Dimensions (Reference Framework)

As you read each profile, consider these aspects:

1. **Technical Control** - How clean and intentional is the execution?
2. **Compositional Intelligence** - How effectively does the structure serve the work?
3. **Color/Value Architecture** - How sophisticated is the color and value system?
4. **Surface Quality** - How refined or intentional is the physical handling?
5. **Expressive Voice** - How distinctive and emotionally coherent is the work?

## Level 1 Dimensional Profiles

### **1.0 - Initial Exploration**

- **Technical Control:** Extreme difficulty with basic tool manipulation; cannot create intended shapes or lines consistently; marks are accidental rather than controlled
- **Compositional Intelligence:** No apparent compositional awareness; elements placed randomly with no sense of balance, spacing, or visual hierarchy
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Colors are muddy from over-mixing or garish from lack of understanding; no awareness of value structure or temperature
- **Surface Quality:** Chaotic or accidental surface; unintended smudges, tears, or material buildup; shows frustration with the medium
- **Expressive Voice:** Pure experimentation; discovering what happens when tools touch surface; no recognizable intent beyond exploration

**Key indicator:** Very first attempts with a medium; learning what the tool does at the most basic level

---

### **1.2 - Early Tool Discovery**

- **Technical Control:** Can create basic marks intentionally but with extreme wobble and inconsistency; shapes are recognizable but severely distorted
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Beginning awareness of "ground and sky" or basic spatial zones; elements placed with some thought but no sophisticated organization
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Uses colors "straight from container" without mixing; may achieve some local color but relationships are arbitrary
- **Surface Quality:** Beginning to control material flow; still many accidental marks but fewer unintended consequences
- **Expressive Voice:** Can identify subject matter intent (this is a tree, this is a person) but execution is highly simplified or symbolic

**Key indicator:** Can name what they're trying to create; beginning representational intent emerges

---

### **1.4 - Developing Basic Control**

- **Technical Control:** Growing consistency in mark-making; can create circles, rectangles, and lines with reasonable intention; proportions are often wrong but shapes are identifiable
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Uses basic spatial organization (sky at top, ground at bottom); may show horizon line or size differentiation for depth
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Beginning to mix colors but results are unpredictable; shows awareness that colors should relate to subject (blue for sky, green for grass)
- **Surface Quality:** More deliberate application; can distinguish between areas that should be filled vs. outlined; fewer truly accidental marks
- **Expressive Voice:** Clear subject matter with personal choices (favorite colors, repeated motifs); work reflects enthusiasms even if execution is limited

**Key indicator:** Consistent effort to represent reality or ideas; some planning evident before execution

---

### **1.6 - Late Novice Development**

- **Technical Control:** Reliable basic shapes and lines; can copy simple geometric forms with reasonable accuracy; beginning to control gradations and transitions
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Shows intentional balance or symmetry; may use simple repetition for pattern; aware of focal points even if execution is clumsy
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Can mix secondary colors intentionally; beginning awareness of light vs. dark for simple shading; attempts color harmony
- **Surface Quality:** Controlled, even application in most areas; differentiates textures intentionally (smooth vs. rough); minimal unintended marks
- **Expressive Voice:** Shows emerging preferences in subject matter and treatment; work has personality despite technical limitations; may reference learned styles

**Key indicator:** Clear evidence of practice and improvement; some areas show surprising competence while others lag

---

### **1.8 - Approaching Apprentice**

- **Technical Control:** Can execute most basic techniques reliably; proportions are much improved; perspective attempts are present even if flawed; marks are confident
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Uses learned compositional devices (rule of thirds, symmetry, leading lines) with some success; plans composition before executing
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Understands basic color relationships; can create simple value scales; attempts to show light source with consistent shadow direction
- **Surface Quality:** Refined handling for this level; consistent stroke quality; intentional variation in texture or finish; work appears "finished" rather than abandoned
- **Expressive Voice:** Beginning to develop consistent approach or style; work is no longer purely exploratory; shows influence of studied artists or methods

**Key indicator:** Fundamental tool struggles are largely overcome; ready to focus on learning formal rules and techniques

## Your Task

**Read all 5 profiles above.**

**Select which profile BEST describes the work you evaluated.**

This is a pattern-matching exercise, not a calculation. Which description fits most closely?

**Do not reconsider whether this is Level 1.** You are only determining: Is it 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, or 1.8?
