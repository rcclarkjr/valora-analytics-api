## The 5 Dimensions (Reference Framework)

As you read each profile, consider these aspects:

1. **Technical Control** - How clean and intentional is the execution?
2. **Compositional Intelligence** - How effectively does the structure serve the work?
3. **Color/Value Architecture** - How sophisticated is the color and value system?
4. **Surface Quality** - How refined or intentional is the physical handling?
5. **Expressive Voice** - How distinctive and emotionally coherent is the work?
