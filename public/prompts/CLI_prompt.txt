# Career Level Index (CLI) Calculation Framework - JSON OUTPUT VERSION

## Purpose:
The Career Level Index (CLI) is a scoring system that evaluates the career achievements of artists. It measures an artist's professional development and standing within the art world using seven key categories, resulting in a normalized score ranging from 1.00 to 5.00. A score of 1.00 indicates no measurable achievements, while a 5.00 reflects the maximum possible accomplishments.

## Input Types:
This prompt handles TWO types of input:
1. **Traditional Artist Bio/Resume**: Biographical text describing career achievements
2. **Questionnaire Response**: Formatted as "Artist's Response to Questionnaire Regarding Career Accomplishments" with category-by-category answers

**CRITICAL: Apply the same scoring standards to both input types.**

## How CLI is Calculated:

### 1. Categories and Weights:
The CLI evaluates achievements across the following seven categories, each weighted by its importance to an artist's career:
- **Art Education: 10% (0.10)**
- **Exhibitions: 25% (0.25)**
- **Awards & Competitions: 15% (0.15)**
- **Commissions: 10% (0.10)**
- **Collections: 15% (0.15)**
- **Publications: 15% (0.15)**
- **Institutional Interest: 10% (0.10)**

### 2. Scoring System:
Each category is assigned a score using a three-tiered system:
- **High-Profile Achievement: 1.0** (e.g., solo exhibitions, national awards, museum collections, features in renowned publications)
- **Mid-Profile Achievement: 0.6** (e.g., group exhibitions, local awards, private collections, features in local publications)
- **Low-Profile/None: 0.0** (e.g., no achievements in this category or very minimal activity)

### 3. Mathematical Calculation Requirements:
**FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY - SHOW ALL WORK:**

**Step 1: Calculate Each Weighted Contribution**
For each category: Score × Weight = Contribution

**Step 2: Calculate Raw Score**
Raw Score = Sum of all contributions (must be between 0.00 and 1.00)

**Step 3: Apply CLI Formula - CRITICAL MATH STEP**
CLI = (Raw Score × 4.0) + 1.00

**MANDATORY: Show each part of this calculation explicitly:**
- Raw Score × 4.0 = [Raw Score] × 4.0 = [intermediate result]
- [intermediate result] + 1.00 = [FINAL CLI VALUE]

**Step 4: Verification Check**
- Raw Score must be between 0.00 and 1.00 ✓
- CLI must be between 1.00 and 5.00 ✓
- CLI must be LARGER than Raw Score (because you added at least 1.00) ✓
- If any check fails, recalculate from Step 1

## Rules and Safeguards:

### 1. Structured Category Analysis:
Each category must be scored with the following structure:
- **What was provided**: Description of achievements
- **Why the score was assigned**: Explanation of the assigned score 
- **Final score contribution**: Weighted contribution to the overall CLI

### 2. Scoring Guidelines:
- **High-Profile (1.0)**: Major achievements, national/international recognition
- **Mid-Profile (0.6)**: Regional achievements, local recognition, moderate activity
- **Low-Profile/None (0.0)**: No meaningful achievements or very minimal activity

### 3. Arithmetic Validation:
**CRITICAL: Double-check every calculation**
- **VERIFY** that Low-Profile/None = 0.0 points (not 0.6)
- **VERIFY** that Mid-Profile = 0.6 points 
- **VERIFY** that High-Profile = 1.0 points
- **VERIFY** that CLI must be larger than Raw Score

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Output ONLY valid JSON** - no additional text before or after
- **Use exact field names** as shown above
- **Ensure all numbers are numeric values**, not strings
- **Double-check all calculations** before outputting
- **Verify CLI is between 1.00 and 5.00**
- **Verify Low-Profile/None categories get 0.0 points**

## FINAL REMINDER:
- Show every mathematical step in calculation_steps
- Double-check that Low-Profile/None = 0.0 (not 0.6)
- Verify your final CLI is between 1.00 and 5.00
- Output valid JSON only
