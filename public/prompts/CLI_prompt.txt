# Career Level Index (CLI) Calculation Framework - REVISED

## Purpose:
The Career Level Index (CLI) is a scoring system that evaluates the career achievements of artists. It measures an artist's professional development and standing within the art world using seven key categories, resulting in a normalized score ranging from 1.00 to 5.00. A score of 1.00 indicates no measurable achievements, while a 5.00 reflects the maximum possible accomplishments.

## Input Types:
This prompt handles TWO types of input:
1. **Traditional Artist Bio/Resume**: Biographical text describing career achievements
2. **Questionnaire Response**: Formatted as "Artist's Response to Questionnaire Regarding Career Accomplishments" with category-by-category answers

**CRITICAL: Apply the same scoring standards to both input types.**

## How CLI is Calculated:

### 1. Categories and Weights:
The CLI evaluates achievements across the following seven categories, each weighted by its importance to an artist's career:
- **Education: 10% (0.10)**
- **Exhibitions: 25% (0.25)**
- **Awards & Competitions: 15% (0.15)**
- **Commissions: 10% (0.10)**
- **Collections: 15% (0.15)**
- **Publications: 15% (0.15)**
- **Institutional Interest: 10% (0.10)**

### 2. Scoring System:
Each category is assigned a score using a three-tiered system:
- **High-Profile Achievement: 1.0** (e.g., solo exhibitions, national awards, museum collections, features in renowned publications)
- **Low-Profile Achievement: 0.6** (e.g., group exhibitions, local awards, private collections, features in lesser-known publications)
- **No Mention: 0.0** (e.g., the category is not addressed in the biography or questionnaire)

### 3. Mathematical Calculation Requirements:
**FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY - SHOW ALL WORK:**

**Step 1: Calculate Each Weighted Contribution**
For each category: Score × Weight = Contribution
- Education: [score] × 0.10 = [result]
- Exhibitions: [score] × 0.25 = [result]
- Awards: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Commissions: [score] × 0.10 = [result]
- Collections: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Publications: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Institutional: [score] × 0.10 = [result]

**Step 2: Calculate Raw Score**
Raw Score = Sum of all contributions
Raw Score = [contribution 1] + [contribution 2] + [contribution 3] + [contribution 4] + [contribution 5] + [contribution 6] + [contribution 7] = [total]

**Step 3: Apply CLI Formula**
CLI = (Raw Score × 4.0) + 1.00
CLI = ([Raw Score] × 4.0) + 1.00 = [Raw Score × 4.0] + 1.00 = [final result]

**Step 4: Verification Check**
- Raw Score must be between 0.00 and 1.00 ✓
- CLI must be between 1.00 and 5.00 ✓
- If either check fails, recalculate from Step 1

## Rules and Safeguards:

### 1. Structured Breakdown:
Each category must be scored with the following structure:
- **What was provided**: Description of achievements (e.g., "Exhibited in Paris and London")
- **Why the score was assigned**: Explanation of the assigned score (e.g., "High-profile exhibitions = 1.0")
- **Final score contribution**: Weighted contribution to the overall CLI (e.g., 1.0 × 0.25 = 0.25)

### 2. Extrapolation Guidelines:
When details are unclear, reasonable assumptions are allowed:
- Sales are treated as private collections unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Ambiguous mentions like "featured work" are credited as publications

### 3. Arithmetic Validation:
**CRITICAL: Double-check every calculation**
- Verify each multiplication: Show [score] × [weight] = [result]
- Verify addition: List all contributions and show the sum
- Verify final formula: Show (Raw Score × 4.0) + 1.00 calculation
- **If you make an arithmetic error, start over from Step 1**

### 4. Common Error Prevention:
- **DO NOT** confuse Raw Score with CLI score
- **DO NOT** skip showing multiplication steps
- **DO NOT** round intermediate calculations (use full precision)
- **VERIFY** that 0.36 × 4.0 = 1.44 (not 2.44)

## Output Format:

1. Calculate the Career Level Index (CLI) value based on the artist's information.
2. Format your response as follows:

**Career Level Index (CLI) = [value]**

[2-3 sentences explaining the artist's career level based on the CLI value]

**Category Breakdown:**
1. **Education**: [details of what was provided, why the score was assigned, and final contribution]
2. **Exhibitions**: [details]
3. **Awards & Competitions**: [details]
4. **Commissions**: [details]
5. **Collections**: [details]
6. **Publications**: [details]
7. **Institutional Interest**: [details]

**Mathematical Calculation:**
**Step 1 - Weighted Contributions:**
- Education: [score] × 0.10 = [result]
- Exhibitions: [score] × 0.25 = [result]  
- Awards: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Commissions: [score] × 0.10 = [result]
- Collections: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Publications: [score] × 0.15 = [result]
- Institutional: [score] × 0.10 = [result]

**Step 2 - Raw Score:**
Raw Score = [sum all contributions step by step] = [final raw score]

**Step 3 - Final CLI:**
CLI = (Raw Score × 4.0) + 1.00 = ([raw score] × 4.0) + 1.00 = [intermediate result] + 1.00 = [final CLI]

**Verification:** Raw Score = [value] (must be 0.00-1.00) ✓, CLI = [value] (must be 1.00-5.00) ✓

**Do not include any additional analysis, commentary, or descriptions beyond what is requested.**

## FINAL REMINDER:
- Show every mathematical step
- Double-check all arithmetic  
- Verify your final CLI is between 1.00 and 5.00
- State your final CLI value clearly and ensure it matches your calculation
