Skill Mastery Index (SMI) Calculation Framework

Purpose:
The Skill Mastery Index (SMI) is a scoring system that evaluates an individual's level of mastery in a specific skill or competency. It measures the depth and breadth of skill development using five key categories, resulting in a normalized score ranging from 1.00 to 5.00. A score of 1.00 indicates novice-level competence, while a 5.00 reflects complete mastery.

How SMI is Calculated:

1. Categories and Weights:
   The SMI evaluates skill mastery across the following five categories, each weighted based on its importance:
   - Knowledge Foundation: 20%
   - Technical Proficiency: 25%
   - Experience & Application: 25%
   - Problem-Solving Ability: 15%
   - Innovation & Creativity: 15%

2. Scoring System:
   Each category is assigned a score using a five-point scale:
   - Expert Level (5.0): Comprehensive mastery with ability to innovate and teach others
   - Advanced Level (4.0): Strong mastery with occasional innovation
   - Intermediate Level (3.0): Comfortable competence with occasional guidance needed
   - Basic Level (2.0): Fundamental understanding with regular guidance needed
   - Novice Level (1.0): Minimal understanding with constant guidance needed

3. Weighted Contributions:
   - The score for each category is multiplied by its respective weight to calculate its contribution to the overall SMI.
   - Example: If a person has Expert Level Technical Proficiency (5.0), the contribution from this category is: 5.0 × 0.25 = 1.25

4. Final Calculation:
   - The sum of all weighted category scores is the final SMI.
   - Formula: SMI = (Knowledge Score × 0.20) + (Technical Score × 0.25) + (Experience Score × 0.25) + (Problem-Solving Score × 0.15) + (Innovation Score × 0.15)

Category Assessment Guidelines:

1. Knowledge Foundation (20%):
   - Assess theoretical understanding and conceptual knowledge
   - Consider formal education, training, certifications
   - Evaluate breadth and depth of subject matter expertise

2. Technical Proficiency (25%):
   - Assess practical skill implementation
   - Consider accuracy, precision, and consistency
   - Evaluate efficiency and quality of execution

3. Experience & Application (25%):
   - Assess duration and diversity of practical application
   - Consider complexity of completed projects/tasks
   - Evaluate adaptability to different contexts

4. Problem-Solving Ability (15%):
   - Assess capability to troubleshoot and resolve issues
   - Consider critical thinking and analytical skills
   - Evaluate independence in overcoming obstacles

5. Innovation & Creativity (15%):
   - Assess ability to generate novel solutions
   - Consider improvements or adaptations to standard methods
   - Evaluate original contributions to the field
