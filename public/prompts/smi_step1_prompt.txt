# SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) - STEP 1 EVALUATION

## Your Task
Evaluate the provided artwork and assign it an integer score from 1 to 5 based on the level of mastery demonstrated in this single work.

## Critical Evaluation Principles

**Evaluate with complete objectivity:**

You are evaluating THIS WORK ONLY, not the artist's overall capability or potential. Judge solely on observable qualities present in this specific piece.

**Do NOT adjust your scoring based on:**
- Artist identity, fame, or historical importance (no halo effect for recognized masters)
- Perceived age or experience level of creator (no lenience for beginners)
- Effort or time invested (a labored work can still be Level 1)
- Potential or development trajectory of the creator
- Desire to encourage or discourage (this is diagnostic, not motivational)

**A Level 1 work is Level 1 regardless of who created it. A Level 5 work is Level 5 regardless of who created it.**

Evaluate as if you have no knowledge of who created it, when it was created, or its historical significance. A famous masterwork should score 5 only because of observable qualities in the work itself—not because you recognize it as historically important.

## The 5 Levels of Mastery

### **Level 1: Novice**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work show struggle with basic tool control?

**Observable markers:**
- **Unintentional inconsistencies:** Lines that should be straight are wobbly, shapes that should be symmetrical are uneven, colors are muddy or garish from poor mixing
- **No evidence of planning:** Elements appear placed randomly or experimentally; composition happens by accident rather than design
- **Fundamental errors:** Perspective fails, proportions are significantly off, values don't create form, colors don't create space
- **Derivative without understanding:** Direct copying of reference with major distortions or simplifications

**Key differentiator:** The gap between apparent intent and execution is large; technical limitations prevent realization of even simple ideas

### **Level 2: Apprentice**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work show rule-following with limited technical range and uneven execution quality?

**Observable markers:**
- **Limited technical range:** Demonstrates competence in a narrow set of fundamental skills (typically 2-4 basic techniques such as clean application, simple shapes, basic color, straightforward composition) but shows little breadth beyond these
- **Isolated skills, not integrated:** Can execute individual techniques competently (clean edges, flat color, simple forms) but struggles when multiple skills must work together simultaneously—cannot coordinate diverse technical demands into coherent solutions
- **Competent replication from reference,** but with visible errors in proportion, perspective, or lighting logic when attempting skills outside the limited repertoire
- **"By the book" decisions throughout:** Rule of thirds composition, complementary color schemes, standard lighting setups—learned formulas applied to simple, straightforward tasks
- **Inconsistent quality within the piece:** Some areas well-executed (using familiar, isolated skills), others weak (attempting unfamiliar skills or coordination); suggests growing but unreliable and narrow skill set
- **Generic aesthetic:** Looks like standard student work in an established style; no distinguishing characteristics beyond subject matter

**Key differentiator:** Can execute a limited set of fundamentals reliably in isolation, but quality drops when complexity increases or when multiple skills must coordinate; follows recipes rather than making creative choices; limited technical vocabulary with little integration

### **Level 3: Journeyman**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Is this work technically sound across multiple skill dimensions but aesthetically predictable?

**Observable markers:**
- **Broad technical proficiency:** Demonstrates reliable mastery across multiple coordinated skills (typically 6+ techniques working together: perspective, atmospheric effects, color relationships, texture, spatial depth, value structure, composition, etc.)
- **Integrated skills working together:** Successfully coordinates multiple techniques into coherent wholes—not just executing individual skills well, but combining them to solve complex, multi-dimensional challenges where different elements must support each other
- **No major fundamental errors:** Anatomy, perspective, color relationships, lighting, and composition all function correctly across this broad range, working in harmony
- **Clean, controlled execution:** Consistent mark quality, deliberate edge control, intentional color mixing—technical reliability maintained even when juggling diverse technical demands simultaneously
- **Safe, conventional choices:** Balanced composition, harmonious colors, proper focal point—everything "works" across all dimensions but nothing surprises
- **Anonymous competence:** Remove any signature and this could be by any skilled practitioner; lacks distinctive voice despite comprehensive technical capability and successful integration

**Key differentiator:** Broad, integrated technical mastery—successfully coordinates multiple complex skills working together into coherent execution—but remains creatively generic; handles multi-faceted technical challenges where diverse elements must harmonize, yet produces nothing memorable; "professional stock art" quality with extensive, integrated skill deployment

### **Level 4: Expert**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work demonstrate a distinctive, coherent aesthetic vision?

**Observable markers:**
- **Confident execution serving creative intent:** Any rule-breaking is clearly deliberate and effective (unusual cropping, unexpected color relationships, distinctive mark-making)
- **Strong point of view throughout:** Every element reinforces a specific mood, style, or message; choices feel authored, not default
- **Recognizable handling:** Color palette, compositional approach, or technical treatment is distinctive enough to be memorable
- **Stylistic coherence:** All decisions work together as a unified aesthetic system; nothing feels arbitrary or out of place

**Key differentiator:** This specific treatment feels unique and intentional; has personality and creative authority; you'd recognize other works in this style

---

### **Level 5: Master**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work transcend technique to achieve conceptual inevitability?

**Observable markers:**
- **Technique becomes invisible:** Viewer responds to emotion/meaning/beauty first; execution is so assured it disappears
- **Economy and restraint:** Maximum impact with minimum elements; nothing excessive, nothing missing; what's excluded is as important as what's included
- **Inevitable rightness:** Every choice feels necessary; cannot imagine the work any other way; appears effortless despite profound sophistication
- **Timeless quality:** Transcends stylistic trends; feels complete and universal rather than tied to a particular aesthetic movement

**Key differentiator:** Work operates beyond style/technique into realm of profound expression; unreproducible by others despite apparent simplicity; emotional or conceptual depth that resonates universally
