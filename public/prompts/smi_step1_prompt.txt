# SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) - STEP 1 EVALUATION

## Your Task
Evaluate the provided artwork and assign it an integer score from 1 to 5 based on the level of mastery demonstrated in this single work.

## Critical Evaluation Principles

**Evaluate with complete objectivity:**

You are evaluating THIS WORK ONLY, not the artist's overall capability or potential. Judge solely on observable qualities present in this specific piece.

**Do NOT adjust your scoring based on:**
- Artist identity, fame, or historical importance (no halo effect for recognized masters)
- Perceived age or experience level of creator (no lenience for beginners)
- Effort or time invested (a labored work can still be Level 1)
- Potential or development trajectory of the creator
- Desire to encourage or discourage (this is diagnostic, not motivational)

**A Level 1 work is Level 1 regardless of who created it. A Level 5 work is Level 5 regardless of who created it.**

Evaluate as if you have no knowledge of who created it, when it was created, or its historical significance. A famous masterwork should score 5 only because of observable qualities in the work itself—not because you recognize it as historically important.

## The 5 Levels of Mastery

### **Level 1: Novice**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work show struggle with basic tool control?

**Observable markers:**
- **Unintentional inconsistencies:** Lines that should be straight are wobbly, shapes that should be symmetrical are uneven, colors are muddy or garish from poor mixing
- **No evidence of planning:** Elements appear placed randomly or experimentally; composition happens by accident rather than design
- **Fundamental errors:** Perspective fails, proportions are significantly off, values don't create form, colors don't create space
- **Derivative without understanding:** Direct copying of reference with major distortions or simplifications

**Key differentiator:** The gap between apparent intent and execution is large; technical limitations prevent realization of even simple ideas

---

### **Level 2: Apprentice**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work show competent execution of SIMPLE, straightforward tasks with limited technical range?

**Observable markers:**
- **Simple technical tasks:** The work involves straightforward challenges—flat color application, basic geometric forms, clean edges, simple patterns, elementary compositions. Even when executed precisely, these represent simple tasks that do not require the technical breadth or complexity of higher levels.
- **Competent replication from reference,** but with visible errors in proportion, perspective, or lighting logic when attempting more complex challenges
- **"By the book" decisions throughout:** Rule of thirds composition, complementary color schemes, standard formulas applied to simple, straightforward subjects
- **Inconsistent quality within the piece:** Some areas well-executed (simple tasks), others weak (when complexity increases); suggests growing but limited skill set
- **Generic aesthetic:** Looks like standard student work; no distinguishing characteristics beyond subject matter

**Key differentiator:** Can execute simple, straightforward tasks competently, but quality drops when facing complex, multi-dimensional challenges; follows recipes rather than making creative choices; limited to basic technical vocabulary

---

### **Level 3: Journeyman**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Is this work technically sound when handling COMPLEX, multi-dimensional challenges but aesthetically predictable?

**Observable markers:**
- **Complex technical challenges mastered:** Successfully handles sophisticated tasks—rendering three-dimensional form, creating atmospheric depth, managing multiple light sources, differentiating textures, building spatial recession. These are complex challenges that require broad technical mastery beyond simple precision.
- **No major fundamental errors:** Anatomy, perspective, color relationships, lighting, and composition all function correctly across these complex demands
- **Clean, controlled execution:** Consistent mark quality, deliberate edge control, intentional color mixing maintained even when juggling multiple technical challenges
- **Safe, conventional choices:** Balanced composition, harmonious colors, proper focal point—everything "works" but nothing surprises
- **Anonymous competence:** Remove any signature and this could be by any skilled practitioner; lacks distinctive voice

**Key differentiator:** Handles complex, multi-faceted technical challenges competently—demonstrates broad technical proficiency when facing sophisticated demands—but remains creatively generic; "professional stock art" quality

### **Level 4: Expert**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work demonstrate a distinctive, coherent aesthetic vision?

**Observable markers:**
- **Confident execution serving creative intent:** Any rule-breaking is clearly deliberate and effective (unusual cropping, unexpected color relationships, distinctive mark-making)
- **Strong point of view throughout:** Every element reinforces a specific mood, style, or message; choices feel authored, not default
- **Recognizable handling:** Color palette, compositional approach, or technical treatment is distinctive enough to be memorable
- **Stylistic coherence:** All decisions work together as a unified aesthetic system; nothing feels arbitrary or out of place

**Key differentiator:** This specific treatment feels unique and intentional; has personality and creative authority; you'd recognize other works in this style

---

### **Level 5: Master**
**Primary Diagnostic:** Does this work transcend technique to achieve conceptual inevitability?

**Observable markers:**
- **Technique becomes invisible:** Viewer responds to emotion/meaning/beauty first; execution is so assured it disappears
- **Economy and restraint:** Maximum impact with minimum elements; nothing excessive, nothing missing; what's excluded is as important as what's included
- **Inevitable rightness:** Every choice feels necessary; cannot imagine the work any other way; appears effortless despite profound sophistication
- **Timeless quality:** Transcends stylistic trends; feels complete and universal rather than tied to a particular aesthetic movement

**Key differentiator:** Work operates beyond style/technique into realm of profound expression; unreproducible by others despite apparent simplicity; emotional or conceptual depth that resonates universally
