# SKILL MASTERY INDEX (SMI) - STEP 2 EVALUATION
## Decimal Refinement for LEVEL 3 Work

You have determined this work is **LEVEL 3: Journeyman**.

**This decision is LOCKED. Do not reconsider the integer level.**

Your task now is to determine WHERE within Level 3 this work falls by selecting which of the 5 profiles below best describes the work.

---

## The 5 Dimensions (Reference Framework)

As you read each profile, consider these aspects:

1. **Technical Control** - How clean and intentional is the execution?
2. **Compositional Intelligence** - How effectively does the structure serve the work?
3. **Color/Value Architecture** - How sophisticated is the color and value system?
4. **Surface Quality** - How refined or intentional is the physical handling?
5. **Expressive Voice** - How distinctive and emotionally coherent is the work?

## Level 3 Dimensional Profiles

### **3.0 - Just Entered Journeyman**

- **Technical Control:** No major fundamental errors, but occasional minor slips in drawing, perspective, or value structure; overall execution is clean and competent
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Compositions are balanced and functional but feel somewhat formulaic; uses standard arrangements (centered subject, rule of thirds) safely
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Harmonious color relationships and proper value structure; colors work together but choices are predictable and conventional
- **Surface Quality:** Consistent, controlled handling throughout; professional surface quality but without distinctive character or flair
- **Expressive Voice:** Generic professional competence; could be stock photography or illustration; technically sound but personality-free

**Key indicator:** Just crossed into reliable technical execution; "technically correct but boring" describes the work accurately

### **3.2 - Early Journeyman**

- **Technical Control:** Very clean execution with excellent fundamental accuracy; no errors that distract from the work; technique is invisible and reliable
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Solid compositional choices that effectively organize the work; may use standard arrangements but executes them very well
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Sophisticated color harmony and well-structured values; understands and applies color theory effectively; palette is pleasant and balanced
- **Surface Quality:** Refined, consistent handling; professional finish quality; mark-making is economical and purposeful but not yet distinctive
- **Expressive Voice:** Polished professional work without strong personality; well-executed but interchangeable with other skilled practitioners; "high-quality generic"

**Key indicator:** Exemplary technical execution of conventional approaches; "professional stock art" or "competent commercial work"

---

### **3.4 - Mid Journeyman**

- **Technical Control:** Excellent technical execution that can be adapted to serve creative needs; technique is confident enough to attempt challenging effects
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Strong compositions that go beyond formulas; effective use of negative space, rhythm, or asymmetry; shows compositional intelligence
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Confident color choices with personal preferences emerging; may push saturation, use limited palettes, or emphasize temperature in distinctive ways
- **Surface Quality:** Refined handling with hints of personal style; consistent approach to mark-making or surface treatment that's beginning to be recognizable
- **Expressive Voice:** Subtle personal touches emerging in color preferences, subject treatment, or compositional approaches; work feels authored rather than anonymous

**Key indicator:** Technical mastery is established; small seeds of personal voice are beginning to sprout; "very good professional work with hints of personality"

---

### **3.6 - Late Journeyman**

- **Technical Control:** Masterful technical execution that serves creative intent; can break technical rules successfully for effect; technique is fluid and adaptable
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Sophisticated, creative compositions that feel fresh while remaining effective; strong use of visual hierarchy and eye flow
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Distinctive color sensibility; palette choices feel personal and intentional; uses color expressively to enhance mood or narrative
- **Surface Quality:** Recognizable surface quality or handling approach; mark-making has character; consistent stylistic choices in texture or finish
- **Expressive Voice:** Clear personal aesthetic preferences; work has personality and point of view; beginning to be recognizable as by this specific creator

**Key indicator:** Personal voice is emerging clearly; work is technically excellent AND beginning to have distinctive character; "approaching a signature style"

---

### **3.8 - Approaching Expert**

- **Technical Control:** Complete technical fluency; technique serves creative vision effortlessly; can work in multiple styles or approaches without loss of quality
- **Compositional Intelligence:** Original, compelling compositions that feel inevitable; sophisticated understanding of visual narrative and eye direction
- **Color/Value Architecture:** Strong, recognizable color identity; uses color as a primary expressive tool; palette is distinctive and sophisticated
- **Surface Quality:** Highly refined with distinct character; surface treatment is an integral part of the aesthetic; recognizable handling
- **Expressive Voice:** Coherent personal aesthetic system; work is immediately recognizable; shows clear artistic voice and consistent point of view

**Key indicator:** Strong personal style forming; work is both technically masterful and aesthetically distinctive; "signature style is crystallizing"

## Your Task

**Read all 5 profiles above.**

**Select which profile BEST describes the work you evaluated.**

This is a pattern-matching exercise, not a calculation. Which description fits most closely?

**Do not reconsider whether this is Level 3.** You are only determining: Is it 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, or 3.8?
